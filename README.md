### Internet

- [IMAP Protocol Documentation](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/imap.htm); IMAP4 Protocol.
- I believe the imbox library uses .uid() to build its query
- [UID Source Code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/imaplib.py#L862)

# Imbox

### Things To Improve

- Add a limit to imbox.message()
  -- here is where emails are downloaded to memory (highly memory intensive)
- Add a ascending/descending order
- Add pagination; retrieve emails

### Internet Message Access Protocol

Imbox uses a uid lookup. It makes it hard to make the necessary changes to the library, such as reverse as it creates a unique id's for that session. Ordering must be done with those ids and not by date as it would be with [list()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html#imaplib.IMAP4.list), [search()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html#imaplib.IMAP4.search), or [sort()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html#imaplib.IMAP4.sort). The reason to do this is to add pagination. Read More Here: [INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc3501.txt)

```
2.3.1.1.

Unique identifiers are assigned in a strictly ascending fashion in the mailbox; as each message is added to the mailbox it is assigned a higher UID than the message(s) which were added previously.
